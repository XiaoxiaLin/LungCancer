1.png			Exact same architecture as in Hammack's CNN model v29. Training two models: false positiveness and malignancy. Validation/train split was performed with ratio 25:75, correspondingly. 64x64x64 patches were used, all stages concatenated together. Random batch exrtaction was taking place. 30 epochs were berformed with 150 batches per epoch, with 20 patches per batch. Next steps: combat overfitting (regularization, dropout), make sure all the labels are correct.
